[TOC]

This is the final project needed to complete the Code Louisville course. The landin page will contain all of the ["requirements"](https://github.com/CodeLouisville/Student-Resources/wiki/Front-End-Web-Development-Project-Requirements) necessary for project to be considered complete (based on requirements docs link above).

- I will continue to develop other projects and include them with this project as seperate pages. Extra stuff to show my ***kung-fu*** is strong.
- Using beta version of MaterializeCSS. This version drops the dependency for jQuery.
- .nomedia files were included in all folders (make sure empty folders were included in repo).

I attempted to use a single index.html for all modules. I wanted to use AJAX and load the content section of the website when a user browsed to the module from navigation. Unfortunately I am having some issue with this. I will continue to look into this for possible change later.

## The following are pointers to project requirements.

### Responsive Design
  - Site is good down to about 300 pixels.
  - sideNav is 280 pixels wide. Anything below that and the only way to get the nav to disappear is to select a nav option.
  - even with sidenav issues site is still functional (basic layout at least), however the layout/formating goes out the window.

### CSS
  - .shrinkTheMonkey, div[class*="mediaBreak"] and #brand should meet the requirements for the project. Can be found in app.css file.
  - multiple other "custom" selectors are there as well, this is just a list of three.
  - selectors supplied that modify interface so it is useable for various screen sizes (hide elements, change font and image sizes).

### JavaScript
  - jQuery functions and methods included in seperate file. $( document ).ready function is listed in main.js file along with several other jQuery method calls for interface useability.

### Comments

- Sufficient comments included in index.html, app.css and main.js file to meet requirements.

### GitHub

- Final project is stored on GitHub.
- Project is also hosted using GitHub Pages.

### Readme file included, as shown.

### Encouraged to include external library. 

- jQuery is included along with several others for various "features".

### Requirement final note. 

- The initial page layout and functionality meets all requirements for the final project.
