# Code Louisville Front End Web Development Final Project, May 2018 Course

The following is the final project for the above listed course.

The initial landing page (index.html) contains all of the requirements listed in the [Student Resource Wiki](https://github.com/CodeLouisville/Student-Resources/wiki/Front-End-Web-Development-Project-Requirements).

The project will be hosted on GitHub Pages and will contain nothing but HTML/CSS/Javascript. It will be broken down into several modules. Besides the initial page the modules will contain additional code for various other "projects".

- Where possible css/javascript files, for external libraries, are included in the project. I tried to avoid using external references, where possible, for security reasons.
- .nomedia files were included in all folders.
