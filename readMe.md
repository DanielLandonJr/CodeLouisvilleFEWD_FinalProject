# Code Louisville Front End Web Development Final Project, May 2018 Course

**NOTHING SPECIAL IS REQUIRED TO VIEW THIS FINAL PROJECT**

This is the final project needed to complete the Code Louisville course. The first page will contain all of the ["requirements"](https://github.com/CodeLouisville/Student-Resources/wiki/Front-End-Web-Development-Project-Requirements) for the project to be completed, all additional pages will include various other code samples to flesh out the project.

- The project will be hosted on GitHub Pages and will contain nothing but HTML/CSS/Javascript. It will be broken down into several modules. The modules will contain additional code for various other "projects".
- Will use materialze css/js for build layout.
- Where possible css/javascript files, for external libraries, are included in the project. I tried to avoid using external references, where possible, for security reasons.
- .nomedia files were included in all folders (make sure empty folders were included in repo).

The following are pointers to the projects requirements

- CSS
