# Code Louisville Front End Web Development Final Project, May 2018 Course

This is the final project needed to complete the Code Louisville course. The first page will contain all of the ["requirements"](https://github.com/CodeLouisville/Student-Resources/wiki/Front-End-Web-Development-Project-Requirements) for the project to be completed, all additional pages will include various other code samples to flesh out the project.

- The project will be hosted on GitHub Pages and will contain nothing but HTML/CSS/Javascript. It will be broken down into several modules. The modules will contain additional code for various other "projects".
- Will use materialze css/js for build layout.
- Where possible css/javascript files, for external libraries, are included in the project. I tried to avoid using external references, where possible, for security reasons.
- .nomedia files were included in all folders.
- required.css and required.js will contain only those elements that are "requirements" for the project to be complete. All other custom css/js will be in a seperate file.
