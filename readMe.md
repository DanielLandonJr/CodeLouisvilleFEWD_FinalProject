[TOC]

This is the final project needed to complete the Code Louisville course. The landing page will contain all of the ["requirements"](https://github.com/CodeLouisville/Student-Resources/wiki/Front-End-Web-Development-Project-Requirements) necessary for project to be considered complete (based on requirements docs link above).

- I will continue to develop other applications and include them with this project as seperate pages. Extra stuff to show my ***kung-fu*** is strong.
- .nomedia files were included in all folders (make sure empty folders were included in repo).
- Things to look for
  - ES6 Modules used throughout JavaScript.
  - Node-SASS used in development.
  - Used AJAX to load Applications dynamically once main index.html was loaded.
  - Avoided using external libraries when possible. This is a demonstration of skill.
  - FireBase used for language localization.
  - API call to WeatherUnderground.

## The following are pointers to project requirements.

### Responsive Design

- Site is good down to about 320 pixels. Used CSS Grid for layout control.

### CSS

- Multiple customs selectors are scatter throught the CSS. I used NODE and installed SASS for the project. Browse project files to see what I did. Not comfortable with SASS setup, need to come up with a "standard" that I like.

### JavaScript

- There is much JavaScript in this project. Most of it is designed along ES6 modules.

### Comments

- Sufficient comments scattered throughout the project to meet requirements.

### GitHub

- Final project is stored on GitHub.
- Project is also hosted using GitHub Pages.

### Readme file included, as shown.

### Encouraged to include external library. 

- Used Particles.js and Stats.js for some external library action.
- I did not use jQuery. There is nothing wrong with it, IMHO, however I feel it is best to not rely on it for basic stuff. If there is something that comes along that I feel would be better suited for jQuery then I will use it (no reason to reinvent the wheel if jQuery can do it for me).

### Requirement final note. 

- This is a single page application. I have included several other "applications (Language Localization, WeatherUnderground & PolarClock)" to help flesh things out.
- I included a link to the original project for comparison. I found nothing wrong with that site however others felt it was too hard to use (I started making changes to address some of their concerns but stopped...I decided to redesign the site instead to what I have now).
- Several people also thought it was too busy...they are going to love this one as I put as much as I could into this thing. After all it is a demonstration of skill.
