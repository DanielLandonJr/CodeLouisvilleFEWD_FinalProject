## Summary of Requirements for Completion of Code Louisville

The following is a list of the requirements for successfully completing Code Louisville.  If any of the items are not completed, you will not be considered a graduate of this course and unable to continue on with the Code Louisville program.  Please be sure to ask any questions of Code Louisville staff if you have any concerns about completing the requirements. 

- Complete all Treehouse courses listed in each week below.  This includes completing all quizzes and challenges and earning all badges that Treehouse awards for completion. You will be added to the **“Code Lou Front End May 2018”** track in Treehouse which should contain all required courses for you to follow along with, or you can click the links in this document below to go directly to the courses. If you do not see the course added in Treehouse, please contact a staff member to be added. **You are strongly encouraged to complete the Treehouse courses by your meetup day**, as the topics covered may be discussed by your mentors. This may require starting the curriculum earlier than it is assigned.
- Complete your personal project.  This project must be completed by **Friday, July 27th at noon** and must fulfill every requirement listed in the Project Requirements document.  The requirements and other Code Louisville information can be found on the [Student Resources Wiki](https://github.com/CodeLouisville/Student-Resources/wiki).  You should show your project to a mentor well before the due date to ensure requirements are properly met. A link will be sent out via Slack in the last two weeks of class. **You will ‘turn-in’ your project by completing this survey and providing your GitHub link** to your project.
- Attend a minimum of 2 tech events where you meet others involved in technology. Check [LouisvilleTech.org](https://louisvilletech.org/) for a list of eligible events or check with Code Louisville staff if another even you’re interested in isn’t listed.  After completing the event, message @shannonsiders on Slack or email her (shannon@codelouisville.org) and state which event you attended.
- Attend your weekly meetups.  You are highly encouraged to attend every single week, but **more than 3 absences** will result in being removed from the program. You must stay for the duration of class. If you need to leave early, please speak with staff prior to the start of class. An option to switch nights and attend class a different day of the week may be available.
- Respond to Talent Development Specialists’ check-ins throughout the course.

## Project Requirements

The below items are the requirements for your personal project for Code Louisville. Projects are graded on a pass/fail system, thus every required bullet must be met in order for your project to pass. You should discuss your project/plan with mentors in advance to verify that it will meet the requirements, but also to make sure you don't try and tackle too large of a project for this class. The requirements are:

### Your project is responsive to different devices and/or browser sizes or screen resolutions.

- As the browser is resized, your site should alter elements on the page to **improve the display**. The two most common methods to accomplish this is either:
  - CSS media queries that will change elements on your page above or below certain screen sizes
  - Use a framework (such as Bootstrap) to implement responsive design
- A combination of the above two or other responsive options are also acceptable
- You do not have to account for all possible devices and browser sizes, just demonstrate some responsive layout principles
- Adding 100% width to an image or content area will not be enough to qualify for this requirement for Code Louisville
- Changing the color of an element or other extremely superficial changes will not count for this requirement. There must be an effort to improve the usability/functionality of your site through responsive design.

### Your project includes at least 3 custom CSS class and/or ID selectors which are applied to your HTML elements

- These selectors **MUST be located in a CSS file** you created (or used from the provided project template). It cannot be 'inline' CSS found only within your HTML elements
- Using ONLY Bootstrap for your customization does not fulfill this requirement
- You are highly encouraged to use a variety of CSS styles to enrich your site

### Your project includes custom JavaScript including at least one JavaScript function

- You must include some form of JavaScript written by you, and **must be included in a .js file** in your project (no inline JavaScript)
- It **must include at minimum 1 JavaScript function** (the function has to actually perform an action, it cannot just be correct but non-functional code)
- Using a JavaScript framework such as AJAX, Angular, or jQuery can certainly meet this requirement (but is not the only way to do so)
- Just importing/linking Bootstrap (or other frameworks) does not meet this requirement

### Your code has comments
- Every line doesn’t need a comment, but major sections of your CSS, HTML, and/or JavaScript files should have some helpful comments so a reviewer can know what the major parts of your code do

### Your project code is on your GitHub account in its own repository

- If you choose to host your application on a live URL, GREAT! You can share that for demonstration purposes or ease of running - and this is encouraged! But your code must still be available on GitHub for review.

### It must include a README file located at the top level directory of your project providing the following:

- A brief description of your project’s purpose. Example: "A website for my local animal shelter. I tried to enhance their current site by implementing more responsive design and adding some jQuery functionality to create a Contact Me form." Try to think of what would be useful to a potential employer that is looking at your GitHub account without any context or background about Code Louisville or your project.
- Documentation of your 3 CSS selectors and 1 JavaScript function
  - Examples of these are provided in the project template linked above
  - 3 selectors and 1 function are only the bare minimum. Really strong portfolio projects could have dozens of these. You are not required to document every single one (but certainly can!), just the bare minimum of 3 to show that you are aware of and able to document your code.
- If your project requires anything special beyond "Open index.html", then your Readme must included detailed steps on how to view the website. Most front-end dev projects will not need this, but some projects may go beyond the basic requirements and require specific tools or setup to run. If your project does, be sure to include very detailed steps so a reviewer or an employer can successfully run your project. If you choose to host your site on a live URL or GitHub Pages, it is fine to list that URL instead.

### You CANNOT re-use a Treehouse sample project
- Any project which simply takes code from one of the projects that Treehouse provided or walked you through and modifies a few elements (colors, images, names, etc) will not be accepted. You are expected to create a new project for your portfolio
- You are of course welcome to take inspiration and examples from Treehouse and re-use elements of the code you've followed along with, you just can't re-use an entire project.

### Additional

- You are highly encouraged to include a front-end framework such as AJAX, jQuery, or Angular in your project as a demonstration of your ability to utilize these. However, this is not a requirement of a passing project.**
- You are also highly encouraged to add some form of user interactivity to your project where something responds to an action the user performs. However, this is also not a requirement of passing.**
- Have fun! Your project should be something you're proud of and that adequately demonstrates your base knowledge in the concepts you've learned.**

## Testing Your Project

You should test your project on another computer by having someone else obtain and run your project. Several projects in the past have failed to meet requirements because it was written in a way that only worked on that person's computer and not the reviewer's. Your project reviewer will not be responsible for tracking down why your project does not work and this may result in a failed project.

## Mentors

You should talk about your project early and often with your mentors. Explain your idea and the features you are thinking of implementing. They will help you understand if it will meet the requirements or if you've possibly decided to tackle too large of a project for the 12-week time period. Towards the end of the session, you should again show your project to your mentors and get confirmation that it meets the requirements of the project. You are perfectly fine to ask them to confirm so there should be no surprises about whether your project will meet the requirements when it comes time to submit.
